            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
            third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or
            Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
            certain profile information about you from your social media
            provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
            the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
            name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
            other information you choose to make public on such a social media
            platform.
          </p>
          <p className="font18 subTcBlock">
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
            are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
            clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
            control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
            Information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
            that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect,
            use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
            privacy preferences on their sites and apps

            8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

          <p className="font18 subTcBlock">
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
            required by law.
            <br />
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
            <br />
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
            your account or terminate your account, you can: Log in to your
            account settings and update your user account.
            <br />
            Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
            delete your account and information from our active databases.
            However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent
            fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
            enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
            requirements.

          </p>
          <p className="font18 subTcBlock">
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
